🧊 Time-Freeze Rust CI

Keep your code frozen and your productivity on ice. ❄️💻

Time-Freeze is a CI/CD simulation and dashboard built in Rust. It runs live in GitHub Actions with animated ASCII banners, a habit tracker, weekly calendar, and progress simulations — all directly in your CI logs.

Features

Glowing, breathing ASCII splash banner in ice-blue.

Rust-based habit tracker dashboard showing code, exercise, reading, meditation, and sleep.

Weekly calendar with today's progress visually displayed.

CI/CD log simulation with animated progress bars and spinners.

Artifact upload of logs for review.

Fully self-contained Rust workflow (no Python or Node dependencies required).
